  <title>Network monitoring tools including ping</title>
  <description>The iputils package contains basic utilities for monitoring a network,
including ping. The ping command sends a series of ICMP protocol
ECHO_REQUEST packets to a specified network host to discover whether
the target machine is alive and receiving network traffic.
